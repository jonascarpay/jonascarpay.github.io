I am looking for the next challenge in my career!
No matter what industry, part-time, full-time, or even just contracting -- if you're reading this and think we could work together, I want to talk to you.
My only upfront requirement is that work is either remote, in the US, or here in Japan.
To contact me, send an email to `<my twitter handle>@gmail.com`.

My experience:

- Designing and implementing large-scale polyglot software systems used in production at major international companies.
- Combining theoretical CS concepts with real-world engineering practices to produce simple, robust software.
- Comfortable with both leadership positions and more practical engineering work.
